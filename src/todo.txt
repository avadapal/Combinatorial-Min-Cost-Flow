- move random capacity and cost generation from generator to create_graph
- what about random resistance generation? Encapsulate in a function that does not need to be called when min-cost-flow is run?
- why are the demands printed in compute_BFS..?
- encapsulate every for ... cout << ... loop into a function to make code nicer
- encapuslate compute max cap,cost
- what does determine_t output?
- put computeBFS, determine_t and so on all in one function compute_initial_soluiton
-

- document everything, this should be done during writing the code.
